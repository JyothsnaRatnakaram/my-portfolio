  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I’m Jyothsna Ratnakaram, a data analyst with a strong passion for transforming raw data into clear, meaningful insights that support smarter decision-making. I enjoy uncovering patterns, solving problems with data, and creating visual stories that help businesses understand what truly matters.

I have hands-on experience with Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, along with analytical libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. My work focuses on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, dashboard design, and predictive modeling.

With a background in Information Systems and Technology, I bring both technical skills and business understanding—allowing me to translate data into practical, actionable conclusions. I’ve worked on projects involving customer churn prediction, marketing insights, system performance evaluation, and quality-of-life analysis.

I’m passionate about continuous learning, whether through new tools, personal projects, or real-world datasets. I enjoy turning complex data into insights that make an impact.

I’m currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills, grow as a data professional, and contribute to data-driven decision-making.

Feel free to connect, collaborate, or explore my work!.</p>
